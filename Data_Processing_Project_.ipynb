Recall that lexicon based sentiment analysis uses lexicons (dictionaries of words each which is assigned to an emation) and an assicated model that combines the different sentiment scores within a document.

        "Stemming and lemmatization are text preprocessing techniques in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, they reduce the inflected forms of words across a text data set to one common root word or dictionary form, also known as a “lemma” in computational linguistics.\n",

        "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/fct898Xl.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lemmatisation is closely related to stemming. The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster, and the reduced accuracy may not matter for some applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The word \"better\" has \"good\" as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up.\n",
        "The word \"walk\" is the base form for word \"walking\", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatisation.\n",
        "The word \"meeting\" can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb (\"to meet\") depending on the context, e.g., \"in our last meeting\" or \"We are meeting again tomorrow\". Unlike stemming, lemmatisation can in principle select the appropriate lemma depending on the context."
